Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

## History

CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.

As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors

Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheetand Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser. Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).

## Role of CSS in a Web Design

A web design is the soul of a website. It plays an important role in a website’s performance and success. This is the reason why web developers pay specific attention to business web design. A perfect web design ensures better traffic and search engine ranking for a site. Let us see how beneficial CSS is in a web application development.

CSS or cascading style sheets have made the development of web pages a lot easier. CSS allows you to easily link to other documents in a website. With the help of CSS you can have a control over the various elements in different web pages of your site. CSS only defines the structure and content presentation of a website. It has nothing to do with the design of a website. However, the CSS influences how the design will look like after the final process is over. You can control the font, positioning, color and style information of an entire website with the help of a single CSS sheet.

Some of the advantages of using CSS are:

Quick loading and less bandwidth: The reason why CSS is preferred by web developers is because it is lighter than the table layout which consumes a lot of bandwidth. The style sheet is loaded only once and is stored in the cache memory. This way the subsequent pages load faster.

Multiple Browsers Compatible: CSS is compatible with all web browsers. Therefore, a website based on CSS will appear similar in all the web browsers.

Ability to position elements anywhere: With CSS, you can position the elements anywhere in the web page. Thus you can ask the developer to change the position of a particular element if it does not go well with the way you had wanted it to be.

Print friendly web pages: Another important feature of CSS is that it provides print friendly web pages. This is to say that the web pages can be easily printed. The colors, images and other things which are difficult to print can be eliminated and printed easily.

Customization: CSS sheets allow the users to customize the web page. The CSS sheets are stored externally and allow the user to make requisite changes on their own. A number of modern browsers give the liberty of defining their own style sheets to the users. Thus a user can change font properties etc easily.

Search engine friendly: The CSS style sheets make it easier for a website to feature in major search engine results. Since it allows elements to be positioned anywhere, the user can project the main contents first, so that it is easily captured by web spiders. It also provides cleaner HTML codes thus cutting down the job of web spider to search the real content from junk code.

Consistency: CSS provides complete consistency to the web pages. It implies that all the expressions and texts will get their characteristics from external style sheet. Thus a developer need not worry about the change in characteristics of the elements because they can be easily altered at any stage of web development by using CSS.

Portability: CSS also lends portability to the content. With the help of CSS, you can make separate style sheets for different media. Thus the content can be presented in a flexible way. It also allows you to redefine the characteristics of elements in a website to suit the need of the situation.

Therefore, it can be said that CSS plays a very significant role in a web design. It contributes in making it simple and user friendly. Hence, you must ensure that the company you hire for custom web design is well equipped with CSS.
